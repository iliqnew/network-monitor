# network-monitor
Designed to keep track of a machine's network traffic and potentially provide the beginning of a pipeline of filters, alerts and processes. Network Monitor is a project build entirely for the needs of cybersecurity and basic education in networking, development and automatization. Feel free to tweak around with the packets and propose updates.
